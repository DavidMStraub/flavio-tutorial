# flavio tutorial

This is an interactive tutorial about [flavio](https://flav-io.github.io/) - a Python package for flavour phenomenology in the Standard Model and beyond. It makes use of the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook for interactive code examples and of the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) plugin for presentation based on [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

Thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), you can run the tutorial in your browser without needing to install anything. Just click on "launch binder" above and then open the `1 Introduction.ipynb` notebook.

Help about navigating the presentation can be found in the [RISE documentation](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/).

This tutorial was originally written by David M. Straub for the [YETI 2018](http://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/631/overview) school at IPPP Durham, UK.
